"""Plausibility bounds for inverter readings.

Used as defense-in-depth at the sensor layer: a frame that passes CRC but
contains corrupted field positions (e.g., from gateway-induced byte
interleaving when a second TCP client talks to the same Elfin bridge)
can still produce numeric values that decode cleanly. The bounds below
catch that residual class of failures before it contaminates energy
accumulators.

Limits are intentionally generous — the goal is to drop physically
impossible readings, not to second-guess the inverter on anything that
could plausibly be real.
